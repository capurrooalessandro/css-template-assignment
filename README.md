# HTML and CSS Responsive Webpage - Mayerfeld Front-end Developer Practicum Program

## About
The main goal of this project was to create a 3â€“5 page webpage using semantic HTML5 elements and a responsive layout in CSS with Flexbox. Another important goal was to collaborate together on the code-resolving issues that arise from different changes and supporting each other with the workload.

## Theme of the webpage
The webpage also needed a theme, and we chose to design it around a fictional company whose objective is to solve the problem of collaborating across different time zones, thereby removing geographic restrictions.

## Main collaborators

- Nyeleti Sithole - Developer
- Capurro Alessandro - Developer

## Languages used

- HTML5 (for structure and mark-up of the pages)
- CSS3 (for customizing the style and layout of the pages)
